## Prediction Model for San Francisco Building Permits

In this project I created a Random Forest Classifier that can predict if a permit was approved and it's time frame, or if it was denied. 
The project workflow:
    1. Data collection 
    2. Data cleansing and manipulation 
    3. Data Story/Visualizations
    4. EDA/Statistical Testing
    5. Machine Learning Analysis 
   
The final report goes over the whole project in great depth.
